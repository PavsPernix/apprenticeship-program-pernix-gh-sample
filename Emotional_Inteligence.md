# Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
## 1. What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?
Definition:
Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, manage, and express emotions, and to communicate effectively with others.
Key principles:
    • EQ is not correlated with personality type or IQ.
    • Emotional intelligence can be developed at any stage of life.
    • You are responsible for your actions, not your emotions.
    • Understanding your emotions allows you to intercept them when they are not serving you.

EQ can be observed and developed through these abilities:
    • Awareness of emotions

    • Identifying strengths, weaknesses, and emotional triggers
2. Self-Management
    • Regulating emotional responses

    3. Give yourself time to recover
    4. Challenge your thoughts

    • A – Activating Event:
Describe the situation objectively (facts only)
    • B – Beliefs:

    • C – Consequences:
Emotional and behavioral outcomes
→ Evaluate pros and cons of possible actions
    • D – Disrupting Thoughts:
Challenge unhelpful beliefs
Understand the other person’s perspective
Decide how to respond effectively
    • E – Effects:

## 6. Perspective Shifting (Make It a Habit)
    • Consider different points of view
    • Ask more questions
    • Spend time with new people
    • Read books on a variety of topics
This builds flexibility, empathy, and emotional control.

    • Identify what you truly enjoy
    • Find activities that create flow
    • Reduce or remove distractions
    • Use clarity of purpose to improve emotional balance

## 8. Communication & Social Awareness
    • What matters most is not only what you say, but how and in what emotional tone you say it

    • Don’t focus only on your ideas
    • Adapt conversations to mutual interests
    • Communicate with emotional intention

## 9. Communicate with Intention and Impact
    • Understand:
        ○ The intention behind what others say
        ○ The impact they want to create
    • Before speaking, ask yourself:
        ○ What do I want to achieve?
        ○ What impact do I want to make?

## 10. Growth Loop
    • Ask others for feedback and their perspective about you
    • Reflect on what works and what doesn’t
    • Review → Refine → Repeat
