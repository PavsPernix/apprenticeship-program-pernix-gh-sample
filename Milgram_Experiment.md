The Milgram experiment aimed to study the extent to which people obey an authority figure, even when the orders conflict with their moral conscience.

Participants were told they were taking part in a study on learning and memory. They were assigned the role of the “teacher”, while another person (an actor) played the role of the “learner”.

The “teacher” was instructed to administer electric shocks each time the “learner” made a mistake. The shocks increased progressively, from low levels up to 450 volts, labeled as potentially lethal. In reality, no real shocks were administered, but the participant was unaware of this. The “learner” simulated pain, screams, pleas, and eventually silence. When participants hesitated, the experimenter (a scientist wearing a white lab coat) encouraged them to continue with statements such as: “The experiment requires that you continue.”

More than 50% of participants administered the maximum shock of 450 volts, blindly obeying authority. This suggests that most people would deliver a potentially lethal shock simply because a scientist in a lab coat ordered them to do so.

The experiment shows that people can commit morally serious actions not out of cruelty, but due to obedience to authority, especially when they feel the responsibility lies elsewhere. The study highlights the importance of taking personal responsibility, questioning unjust orders, and developing emotional awareness to recognize and manage fear, conformity, and external influence.
